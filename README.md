# Welcome to your Lovable project

This frontend app has been created by Lovable to test out the software. The actual project is located within the /mobile directory.
The lovable app was created solely, to test out its capabilities and play around with "vibe" coding (I don't like that term). It created a pretty decent entry point to further develop it into an actual mobile app.
Which is why it still remains: I will port over the basic parts of the webapp, while deepening my knowledge on React Native and native developement in general.
For more information on the project and the end product. Head over to the README in the mobile directory. [README](/mobile/smart-shopper/README.md)
