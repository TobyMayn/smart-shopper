# Welcome to Smart Shopper 👋

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

I created a very basic frontend app using Lovable to test it out. As Lovable is only able to create apps for the web, I wanted to port it to React Native.
This is my project for just that. I will be porting the existing web app to React Native, and integrate it with my own backend, once the basic features of the native app is complete. 

The end goal is to create a somewhat simple Android/IOS app for creating shopping lists when grocery shopping, that will automatically find any discount available. The app will also show the running total and the potential savings scored from the discounts.

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

## Running tests

To run tests 

```bash
npm run test
```
